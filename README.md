# Crime-Prediction
DAC Project

The Objective of the Project:

        A crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. Crimes are harmful to everyone but still continues everywhere.
        As technology develops the crime rate also increases as people misuse technology and its powers for wrong purposes.
