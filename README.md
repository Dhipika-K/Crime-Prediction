# Crime-Prediction
DAC Project

The Objective of the Project:

        A crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. Crimes are harmful to everyone but still continues everywhere.
        As technology develops the crime rate also increases as people misuse technology and its powers for wrong purposes.
        so here we are going to create a project that will help a person to analyse the crime level in india in a particular state.
                1. To analyze the crime level in our country in the past 20 years.
                2. To predict the crime level approximately in the upcoming years.

Problem Statement:
      
      A person wants to check what will be the crime rate of burgulary or sexual assault of women in the coming year 2023 and
      gets the info in percentage format.
      

The Dataset:
     
        The dataset consists of data aout the number of crimes in different states in India and the gender affected in the crime.
        It contains major information about the burgulary crime happening in different states.
        
What is done using the dataset?
        
        The user's state data will be displayed using the dataset and further predictions will also be made from the dataset.

# Crime-Type-Prediction

## Problem Statement
As crime rates increases it leads to an imbalance in the constituency of a country. Understanding the crime pattern would help us have a response ahead this type of criminal activities. The dataset has record of crime lists of 12 years. We predict the category of crime based on district, day of the week, coordinates and quantity of crime.

## Dataset
The dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/code/yannisp/sf-crime-analysis-prediction/data?select=test.csv.zip from Kaggle

## Models used
First Machine Learning algorithm used was Linear Regression.This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values.

Next K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm was applied to the dataset. It stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm. The accuracy acheived by KNN is found to be greater than Linear Regression.
